# Financial Dashboard

A portfolio-aware market data dashboard built on the [Alpaca APIs](https://docs.alpaca.markets/). It charts price history for a set of symbols, surfaces how those symbols move together, and — when connected to an account with open positions — describes the concentration and risk profile of the portfolio itself.

The emphasis is analytical, not advisory: the app describes properties of the data and the portfolio (returns, correlation, concentration, unrealized P&L). It does not generate trade signals or recommendations.

Built with Next.js 14 (App Router), Tailwind, SWR, and Recharts. Core logic is covered by unit tests (Vitest).

## What works today

**Market data**
- **`/api/bars`** — server-side route that authenticates against Alpaca and pulls daily bars for up to 10 symbols. Credentials stay server-side and are never exposed to the browser. Request parameters are validated with a Zod schema; responses are cached with a revalidation window to reduce load on the upstream API.
- **Multi-symbol chart** — per-symbol closes merged into a single time-ordered series and rendered as an overlaid line chart.
- **Summary cards** — latest close and percent change over the selected window for each symbol.
- **Return correlation heatmap** — pairwise Pearson correlation of daily returns across the selected symbols, so you can see which names move together over the window.
- **Adjustable inputs** — comma-separated symbol list and a 30 / 90 / 180 / 365-day window.

**Portfolio**
- **`/api/positions`** — server-side route that fetches the account's open positions from the Alpaca trading API and derives concentration metrics. Defaults to the paper trading host; configurable via environment variable.
- **Risk panel** — per-position weight by market value, unrealized P&L, and a callout for the single largest holding (concentration risk).

**Cross-cutting**
- Input validation at the route boundary (Zod).
- In-memory rate limiting on the API routes (sufficient for a small demo; see notes below).
- Upstream error details are logged server-side and not leaked to the client.

## Architecture

Pure logic lives in `src/lib/` and is unit-tested in isolation from the routes and UI:

- `bars.js` — reshapes raw Alpaca bars into a charting series and computes per-symbol summaries.
- `correlation.js` — daily returns and the pairwise correlation matrix.
- `risk.js` — volatility (standard deviation) and portfolio concentration by market value.
- `positions.js` — maps Alpaca's string-typed position fields into a numeric, camelCase shape.
- `params.js` — request parameter validation.
- `rateLimit.js` — fixed-window rate limiter.

Route handlers in `src/app/api/` stay thin: authenticate, fetch, delegate to `lib/`, return JSON. Components in `src/components/` are presentational and fetch through SWR.

## Testing

```bash
npm test          # watch mode
npm run test:run  # single run
```

Tests focus on the deterministic core — bar reshaping, correlation, risk, and parameter validation — where they carry the most signal.

## Setup

Requires Node 18+ and an Alpaca account. Paper trading keys are free and work for both market data and positions.

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # then add your keys
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ALPACA_KEY_ID` | Alpaca API key ID. Paper keys start with `PK`. |
| `ALPACA_SECRET_KEY` | Alpaca API secret. |
| `ALPACA_TRADING_HOST` | Trading host. `https://paper-api.alpaca.markets` (paper) or `https://api.alpaca.markets` (live). Must match the keys above. |

Generate keys at https://app.alpaca.markets/ under "API Keys". Paper and live are separate environments with separate keys — a key/host mismatch returns HTTP 401.

> The positions panel shows "No open positions" until the connected account holds some. On a paper account, open a few positions from the Alpaca dashboard to populate the risk and correlation views.

## Not built yet

- Order submission and lifecycle tracking
- Persistence (no database — every request hits Alpaca live)
- Correlation weighted by actual position sizes (portfolio-weighted, not just symbol-level)
- Intraday timeframes and watchlists
- Backtesting
- Financial news and geopolitical feeds

## Notes and limitations

- **Rate limiting is in-memory and per-process** — fine for local use and a small demo. For real deployment across serverless instances, back it with a shared store (e.g. Redis).
- **Data feed** — uses Alpaca's IEX feed, which is delayed. The chart window ends yesterday to avoid requesting bars that don't exist yet.
- **Not investment advice** — the app surfaces descriptive statistics about market data and a portfolio. It does not recommend trades.
